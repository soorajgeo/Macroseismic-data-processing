# Macroseismic-data-processing
This notebook lets you calculate MSKWI and MSK64 from recorded questionnaires/observtions. The values are converted into a nested dictionary (see values.csv for example) and mapped to the observations for calculation of MSKWI and MSK64. An example observation file (observation.csv) is provided for reference.
